# BUILD NOTES

*Build notes for TM351 VCE image.*

## VCE Overview

The VCE provides a computational environment for the module *__TM351__ Data Management and Analysis*. The environment is used to support practical activities for each unit of the module, as well as the TMAs and EMA.

The VCE provides JupyterLab and Jupyter notebook v7 environments for running Jupyter notebooks against a Python kernel (version ??). The environment also includes PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases running as services, and the OpenRefine (Java) applivation running as a web app.

## JupyterLab / Jupyter Notebook Extensions and Settings

Several JupyterLab extensions are preinstalled to support usability:

- `jupyterlab_empinken_extension` (cell background colouring);
- `jupyterlab_cell_status_extension` (cell execution status / accessibility settings);
- `jupyterlab-skip-tracback` (improved Pyhton error handling);
- `jupysql`: SQL magics;

Environment settings are modified away from defaults via custom settings provided in `.jupyter/lab/user-settings/`. In particular, settings are modified to support:

- bracket closing;
- spellchecking against `en_gb` and custom terms.

## Python Kernel Packages

The Python kernel used to support Jupyter notebook execution is pre-installed with a wide variety of packages to support database connections as well as data analysis and visualisation.

Core packages include:

- `pandas` for data analysis;
- `seaborn` for data visualisation;
- `sqlalchemy` for PostgreSQL database connections;
- `pymongo` for MongoDB database connections;
- `folium` for geographical mapping.

## Startup procedure

The startup procedure ensures that:

- the database services are running;
- an OpenRefine project directory is available;
- notebooks are trusted on `notebooks/` path (exlude hidden directories);
- a local persistent copy of the database is created in the mounted filesysten if required. By default this will be enabled in a hidden directory on the `$HOME` path for:
  - the remotely hosted VCE;
  - a locally run VCE with a mounted / shared file system on the presentation home directory.

## ANNUAL MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS

- change instances of presentation code; literal code (e.g. `24J`) currently contained in:
  - `ContainerConfig.yaml`
  - `pyproject.toml`
  - `db_setup/local_db_path/local_db_path.sh`
- check MongoDB version
- check PostgreSQL version
- check OpenRefine version

## Local Running / Testing

Generate a local docker file: `ocb generate`

Build image: `docker build -t test_image .`

Run container: `docker run -p 8877:8888 --name testContainer test_image`

Log in to running container as root: `docker exec -it -u 0 /bin/bash`

## Cross-Building

Currently, only the amd64 container is built by CI, and then pushed to https://hub.docker.com/r/mmh352/tm351/tags

To cross build images for amd64 and arm64 locally:

```bash
# Setup docker build context
docker context create builder-context-tm351
docker buildx create --use builder-context-tm351 --name tm351build

# Cache build layers
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 . --tag  outm351dev/tm351-23jl4

# Push cached layers to docker hub (requires docker login)
# docker login -u mmh352 -p $DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 . --tag  outm351dev/tm351-23jl4 --push

# Tidy up
docker context rm builder-context-tm351
```

### Renaming and Tagging Images Cross-built Elsewhere

If the CI did cross-build and push, we could use the following recipe to create similar images in a new namespace:

```bash

# Pull existing images for both architectures and retag them
docker pull --platform=linux/amd64 mmh352/tm351:24j.0b4
docker tag mmh352/tm351:24j.0b4 ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm351:24j.0b4-amd64

# Local image
docker tag test_image ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm351:24j.0b4-arm64

# Push the tagged images to your repository
docker push ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm351:24j.0b4-amd64
docker push ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm351:24j.0b4-arm64

# Create and push a manifest list
docker manifest create ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm351:24j.0b4 \
    --amend ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm351:24j.0b4-amd64 \
    --amend ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm351:24j.0b4-arm64

docker manifest push ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm351:24j.0b4

docker manifest create ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm351:24j \
    --amend ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm351:24j.0b4-amd64 \
    --amend ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm351:24j.0b4-arm64

docker manifest push ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm351:24j
```

Alternatively, if we need to fettle anything, we can do it via a Dockerfile:

```text
#File: Dockerfile-from_mmh
FROM mmh352/tm351:23j.0b9
```

And then cross-build and push a tenmporary devleiopment version as:

`docker buildx build -f Dockerfile-from_mmh --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 . --tag outm351dev/tm351-23j --push`

For deployment, push a subtagged version, and then the "latest" version in that tag:

`docker buildx build -f Dockerfile-from_mmh --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 . --tag ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm351:23j.0b9 --push`
`docker buildx build -f Dockerfile-from_mmh --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 . --tag ousefulcoursecontainers/ou-tm351:23j --push`
